1. in code above data is assumed to be inside an array, but in production code data will be in database.
I will update the code later when i learn clearly about database mongoDB and backend servers.

above fix: data will be in array in client side, but in server side data will be in databases.
currently i am making client side.

2. candle function has to be updated as follows:
	-> rather than asking for x and pixel to price ratio ask for xScale.
	-> rather than asking for y and pixel to date ratio ask for yScale.
2nd done.

3. directly send or any chartAndAxis inside createScales.

4. make cursor grab when grabbing the chart

5. take a look at what to send via function argument and what to send as export global variables.

6. in Y - axis when number size in increased Y-axis width is increased in trading view, look at that.

7. tick sizes based on data, check all data data having maximum digits after decimal will be tick size.,
as and when data is updated, so is tick size.

(or you can check single data point along with its digits after decimal while it is still in string format because even if less digits it will still have 0s)

8. updating rather than deleting candles and first updating in dom and then appending to its parent.

9. improvement of scale alot it is currently doing for all the data points, but we have to do for only 
displaying data points. will do this first then i will think about x axis

i think done ^^ will recheck

10. x Axis have to make good dates

11. have to add lines horizontal and verticles inside chart
